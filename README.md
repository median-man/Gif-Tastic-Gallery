UCSD Coding Bootcamp - Week 3, Homework 6.

See [GifTastic](https://median-man.github.io/Gif-Tastic-Gallery/) on Github Pages.


## Getting Started

Clone the repository locally and open up index.html in your 
web browser. GifTastic uses the [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/)
to retrieve the gif files. You must be connected to the internet in
order for GifTastic to work.

## Educational Purpose

I'm building this app to learn about and gain experience with jQuery's
AJAX features. This application is intended to satisfy the 
requirements of the 6th homework assignement for the 
[Coding Bootcamp at UCSD Extension](https://codingbootcamp.extension.ucsd.edu/).
