# GifTastic

GifTastic is currently in early development.

The repository contains the files for the GifTastic web application.
GifTastic displays a gallery of gifs (a giffery?) related to a variety
of topics. Users are able to add additional topics.


## Getting Started

Clone the repository locally and open up index.html in your 
web browser. GifTastic uses the [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/)
to retrieve the gif files. You must be connected to the internet in
order for GifTastic to work.

## Educational Purpose

AJAX features. This application is designed to satisfy the 
requirements 6th homework assignement for the
